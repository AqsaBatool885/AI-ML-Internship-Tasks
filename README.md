## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

### Objective
The goal of this task was to build a foundation in data exploration by loading, inspecting, and visualizing a real-world dataset to understand trends and distributions.

### Dataset Used
**Iris Dataset:** A classic dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers, with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and 1 target variable (species).

### Models Applied
* **Data Manipulation:** Pandas
* **Data Visualization:** Seaborn and Matplotlib
* **Statistical Analysis:** Descriptive Statistics (`.describe()`)

### Key Results and Findings
* **Species Separation:** The scatter plot showed that the *Setosa* species is easily distinguishable from *Versicolor* and *Virginica* based on petal length and width.
* **Distributions:** Most features follow a relatively normal distribution, though petal measurements show a clear "gap" between species groups.
* **Outliers:** Box plots revealed a few minor outliers in the `sepal_width` for the *Virginica* species, but the data is generally clean.
